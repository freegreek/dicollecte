THESAURUS EDITION BY E-MAIL
===========================

Edit the mailbox settings in /config/config.php

Then configure your system to launch regularly the script /mailbox_c.php
For example, you can use cron with crontab.

The script will check the mailbox described in /config/config.php

Each mail sent to this mailbox will be performed and answered according to its
pattern.
    
Then, all mails are deleted.

DO NOT USE YOUR USUAL EMAIL ADDRESS, BUT CREATE A DEDICATED EMAIL FOR THIS TASK.
    
Note: the thesaurus is not editable if you don't allow Update by e-mail in the
administration panel of the project.
